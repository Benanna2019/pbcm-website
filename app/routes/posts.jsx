// have general layout for blogs page.

// have the drop down to filter blogs, etc, maybe. I think I like the idea of a blog pages that shows the most recent posts or lists all of them in some fashion.

// Then the visitor to the site can just navigate between posts and the all posts page with a [<- home] button

// TODO:
// Fetch the posts and display them with the tailwind blog components
//

export function meta() {
  return {
    title: "Blog - PBCM Articles",
    description: "Peninsula Biblical Counseling Ministries Blog Posts",
  };
}

export default function Posts() {
  // TODO: map over the data and send it into the blog components

  return <>{/* This will be the individual blog display component */}</>;
}
